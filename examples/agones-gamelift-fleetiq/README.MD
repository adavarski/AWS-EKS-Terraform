# Quickstart - EKS with Agones Gaming Kubernetes Controller 

In this workshop, we will learn how to deploy and run Gaming applications on AWS EKS with Agones Kubernetes Controller

 - Deploy Private VPC, Subnets and all the required VPC endpoints
 - Deploy EKS Cluster with one managed node group in an VPC
 - Deploy Agones Kubernetes Controller using Helm Providers 
 - Deploy a simple gaming server and test the application

# What is Agones

Agones is an Open source Kubernetes Controller with custom resource definitions and is used to create, run, manage and scale dedicated game server processes within Kubernetes clusters using standard Kubernetes tooling and APIs. 
This model also allows any matchmaker to interact directly with Agones via the Kubernetes API to provision a dedicated game server

# What is GameLift

Amazon GameLift enables developers to deploy, operate, and scale dedicated, low-cost servers in the cloud for session-based, multiplayer games. 
Built on AWS global computing infrastructure, GameLift helps deliver high-performance, high-reliability, low-cost game servers while dynamically scaling your resource usage to meet worldwide player demand.

# Deployment Steps

Execute **Step1** only when you are running this workshop using AWS EventEngine. Workshop conducted by the AWS teams at Customer sites

## Step1: Login to Event Engine as advised by AWS team. You may need a temporary AWS Account token for this step

    https://www.eksworkshop.com/020_prerequisites/aws_event/portal/
    
## Step2: Create [Cloud9 IDE in AWS Environment](https://www.eksworkshop.com/020_prerequisites/workspace/#region-1) and install Pre-requisites

Use the following link to install Cloud9 IDE and all the pre-requisites Kubernetes tools

    https://www.eksworkshop.com/020_prerequisites/workspace/#region-1
    
### Step2.1: Install [Kubernetes Tools](https://www.eksworkshop.com/020_prerequisites/k8stools/)
    https://www.eksworkshop.com/020_prerequisites/k8stools/
    
### Step2.2: Create [IAM Role for Workspaces](https://www.eksworkshop.com/020_prerequisites/iamrole/)
    https://www.eksworkshop.com/020_prerequisites/iamrole/
    
### Step2.3: Attach IAM role to Cloud9 IDE and update IAM settings
    https://www.eksworkshop.com/020_prerequisites/ec2instance/
    https://www.eksworkshop.com/020_prerequisites/workspaceiam/ 
    
## Step3: Install `aws-iam-authenticator` in Cloud9 IDE
     curl -o aws-iam-authenticator https://amazon-eks.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1.19.6/2021-01-05/bin/linux/amd64/aws-iam-authenticator
    
     openssl sha1 -sha256 aws-iam-authenticator
    
     chmod +x ./aws-iam-authenticator
    
     mkdir -p $HOME/bin && cp ./aws-iam-authenticator $HOME/bin/aws-iam-authenticator && export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
    
     echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
    
     Verify the installation
    
     aws-iam-authenticator help

## Step4: Install Terraform in Cloud9 IDE

    sudo yum remove -y terraform

    sudo yum install -y yum-utils
    
    sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/AmazonLinux/hashicorp.repo
    
    sudo yum -y install terraform-1.0.1
    
    sudo terraform version
    
## Step5: Clone AWS Terraform AWS from GITHUB Repo

    git clone https://github.com/adavarski/aws-eks-production.git
    
    cd aws-eks-production/
    
## Step6: Run Terraform init on the Gaming EKS Cluster Configuration
`live/preprod/eu-west-1/gaming/test/base.tfvars` file contains the configuration data to create VPC, Subnets, EKS CLuster and the Agones Helm Chart for this workshop
`live/preprod/eu-west-1/gaming/test/backend.conf` file contains the config for setting up Terraform backend state. For this workshop we will be using local backend state to avoid creating a new S3 bucket to copy the state files.

To initialize a working directory with configuration files. 

     terraform init -backend-config ./live/preprod/eu-west-1/gaming/test/backend.conf source
    
## Step7: Run Terraform plan 
To verify the resources created by this execution

     terraform plan -var-file ./live/preprod/eu-west-1/gaming/test/base.tfvars source

## Step8: Finally, Terraform apply 
This step may take up-to 15 to 17 mins to create AWS VPC resources, EKS Cluster and necessary Addons using Helm Provider

     terraform apply -var-file ./live/preprod/eu-west-1/gaming/test/base.tfvars source

## Step9: 
     aws eks --region <region> update-kubeconfig --name <eks cluster name>
    
    e.g., $ aws eks --region eu-west-1 update-kubeconfig --name gaming-preprod-test-eks
    
## Step10: Install K9s 
This step is to install K9s client tool to interact with EKS Cluster 

     curl -sS https://webinstall.dev/k9s | bash

Just type k9s after the installation and then you will see the output like this 

       
![Alt Text](../../images/k9s-agones-cluster.png "K9s") 

## Step11: Add EKS Workshop IAM role as EKS Cluster Administrator
    
    $ aws sts get-caller-identity
    
    ROLE="    - rolearn: arn:aws:iam::${ACCOUNT_ID}:role/TeamRole\n      username: admin\n      groups:\n        - system:masters"
    
    kubectl get -n kube-system configmap/aws-auth -o yaml | awk "/mapRoles: \|/{print;print \"$ROLE\";next}1" > /tmp/aws-auth-patch.yml
    
    kubectl patch configmap/aws-auth -n kube-system --patch "$(cat /tmp/aws-auth-patch.yml)"

## Step12: Deploying the Sample game server

    kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/googleforgames/agones/release-1.15.0/examples/simple-game-server/gameserver.yaml
    
    kubectl get gs
    
Output looks like below

    NAME                       STATE   ADDRESS         PORT   NODE                                        AGE
    simple-game-server-7r6jr   Ready   34.243.345.22   7902   ip-10-1-23-233.eu-west-1.compute.internal   11h

## Step13: Testing the Sample Game Server

    sudo yum install netcat
    
    nc -u <ADDRESS> <PORT>
    
    e.g.,  nc -u 34.243.345.22 7902
    
Output looks like below

    TeamRole:~/environment/aws-eks-production (main) $ echo -n "UDP test - Hello Workshop" | nc -u 34.243.345.22 7902 
    Hello Workshop
    ACK: Hello Workshop
    EXIT
    ACK: EXIT
